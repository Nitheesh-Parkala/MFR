# Reduce
In JavaScript, reduce is a higher-order function that is used to process each element of an array and accumulate a single result. It takes a callback function as its argument, which is applied to each element of the array.

## Things learned:
1. map method is used when we want transformation of whole array.
2. filter is used when we want to filter the array to obtain required value.
3. reduce is used when we want to reduce the array to single value eg (max, min, avg, sum, difference etc).
4. reduce passes two arguments one function(which includes accumulator and initial value as argument itself) and another initial value of accumulator.
